# This file defines the rank level requirements for a subskill.
# You cannot alter how many ranks a skill has, that is coded into mcMMO directly.
# You can however, change when they unlock, if you make all ranks of a skill level 0 for example every player will have the most powerful version of that skill right away.
# Retro Mode and Standard have separate config settings to make it easier for server owners to understand the difference between the two.
# Retro Mode is setup to be an entirely cosmetic change, keeping the old 0-1000 feeling of mcMMO.
# Retro Mode has 10x faster leveling and 10x higher skill requirements, if you do the math you can see its the same as Standard and only cosmetic!.
