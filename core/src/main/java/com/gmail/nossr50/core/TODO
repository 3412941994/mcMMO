This file is just going to take note of all the caveats of mcMMO code as I abstract out bukkit

1) In several places mcMMO is disabling itself, pretty sure this is not a good idea and this should be changed
    eg: in McMMOPlayer, and when loading configs and finding bad values

2) mcMMO uses a a global reference of its Plugin class for Bukkit in order to schedule tasks

3) Need to configure the logger

4) Safety check the hardcore/vampirism commands

5) Tweak configs to not do any string operations

6) Need to add and check validation for all current configs

7) Weird stuff going on with ageables and strings in general in StringUtils

8) Reduce the amount of string operations in mcMMO as much as possible
