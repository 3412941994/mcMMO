This file is just going to take note of all the caveats of mcMMO code as I abstract out bukkit

1) In several places mcMMO is disabling itself, pretty sure this is not a good idea and this should be changed
    eg: in McMMOPlayer, and when loading configs and finding bad vlaues

2) mcMMO uses a a global reference of its Plugin class for Bukkit in order to schedule tasks
